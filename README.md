## Installing Python Application

- From within the `py-app/` directory, Install the dependencies first,
    - `pip install -r dependencies.txt` or `pip3 install -r dependencies.txt`
    - If the dependencies are installed already you will see a message like `Requirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (from -r dependencies.txt (line 2)) (3.3.4)`
- Run the application
    - `python3 controller.py`
